# data description 
Source: https://datadryad.org/dataset/doi:10.5061/dryad.r7sqv9s97
My data set consists of mitochondrial DNA sequences (cyt b and ND4) from the Caspian Cobra and related Asain Cobras, sampled across Iran, Afghanistan and Turkmenistan for phylogenetic analysis.
# QC
My data does not have raw reads or UCEs
# alignment 
downloaded miniconda and mafft 
**Alignment method chosen:** MAFFT
**Algorithm:** Progressive alignment using FFT. Primarily homologous
**Assumptions:** Input sequences are homologous
**Limitations:** May produce less accurate alignments for highly divergent sequences
# command used for alignment 
mafft cobra_data > cobra-aligned-mafft.fasta
